**Abstract:** The relative importance of abiotic versus biotic top-down factors on structuring tundra plant communities is debated. With climate change already strongly affecting the tundra ecosystem, understanding which factors will prevail is vital. Tundra plant communities are presumed to be predominantly structured by their abiotic conditions yet grazing by reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) has a major effect on composition and diversity. It is increasingly recognized, however, that these factors cannot be considered in isolation. Here, I aim to test the relative and interactive effect of abiotic and top- down factors on vegetation structure in the Swedish mountain tundra. Using direct measurements of reindeer grazing via tri-axial accelerometers (from two summers, 2019 and 2020) coupled with remotely-gathered data on landscape features, I examine how species richness and coverage of vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens (sampled in 2022) are driven by grazing duration and abiotic conditions. Abiotic factors, specifically aspect and soil wetness, prevailed as the dominant drivers of local vegetation patterns. Clear interactions between factors were also observed. Reindeer grazing duration had predictable but weak effects on richness, with responses predominantly observed on south-facing slopes. Additionally, soil wetness interacted with grazing duration, with wetter areas grazed far less. These results demonstrate the importance of considering interactions between abiotic and biotic factors, providing a better understanding of how tundra plant communities in northern Sweden might change under future climate change or different grazing regimes. The observed interactions imply divergence in vulnerability between slopes and the potential for effects of herbivory to be altered under future hydrological conditions. I emphasize that future studies should continue to disentangle these relationships.
